<h2>Combined Cycle Power Plant Dataset (CCPP)</h2>

<p>The <a href='http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/294/combined+cycle+power+plant'>dataset</a> contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the plant was set to work with full load.</p>

Additional Information

Features consist of hourly average ambient variables 
- Temperature (T) in the range 1.81°C and 37.11°C,
- Ambient Pressure (AP) in the range 992.89-1033.30 milibar,
- Relative Humidity (RH) in the range 25.56% to 100.16%
- Exhaust Vacuum (V) in teh range 25.36-81.56 cm Hg
- Net hourly electrical energy output (EP) 420.26-495.76 MW
The averages are taken from various sensors located around the plant that record the ambient variables every second. The variables are given without normalization.
